<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About

### Open-Source Tool for the Simulation and Control of any Robot Arm in ROS 2

We are excited to welcome you to our hands-on workshop at ROSCon UK 2025, where we will explore a modular, open-source framework for simulating and controlling robot manipulators in both virtual and real environments using ROS 2, MoveIt!2, and Gazebo. 

Developed by the IFRA-Cranfield Research Group at Cranfield University, this framework is designed to streamline the design, deployment, and operation of robotic workcellsâ€”whether you are working on industrial robots, collaborative robots, or research prototypes. Our aim is to provide you with a standardised, reusable, and flexible development workflow that supports teaching, research, prototyping, and real-world applications. 

This workshop will be highly practical. You will follow each step alongside us to set up your own ROS 2 environment, run robot simulations, control a robot arm, and integrate external software tools such as intelligent vision systems and custom Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs). All resources used in the workshop are fully open-source and will remain available after the session, allowing you to continue experimenting and adapting the framework to your own projects. 

By the end of the workshop, you will: 

- Understand the structure and functionality of our modular ROS 2 framework. 
- Be able to deploy and operate robot workcells in both Gazebo simulation and on real hardware. 
- Know how to integrate external perception and control tools into your ROS 2 workflows. 
- Have a foundation to standardise your robotic development process using reusable packages and launch systems. 

We encourage you to actively participate, ask questions, and share your own insights. The workshop is also a space for discussion on how we can collectively improve and standardise simulation and control practices in ROS 2. 

### ROSCon_UK_2025 Repository

The IFRA-Cranfield/ROSCon_UK_2025 repository contains all the exercises, resources, and example solutions that will be used during the workshop. Having it installed in advance will ensure you can follow each step, replicate demonstrations, and continue experimenting after the session.  

The repository has 2 branches:

- humble: This branch will be used during the workshop. It contains all the tasks and resources required to undertake the Robot Simulation and Control exercises.
- humble-solution: This branch contains all the solutions for the Robot Simulation and Control exercises, along with all the complete source code.

### Intelligent Flexible Robotics and Assembly Group

The IFRA (Intelligent Flexible Robotics and Assembly) Group is part of the Centre for Robotics and Assembly at Cranfield University.

IFRA Group pushes technical boundaries. At IFRA we provide high tech automation & assembly solutions, and we support smart manufacturing with Smart Industry technologies and solutions. Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) are a clear example. They can improve overall operations and throughput quality by adapting to real-time changes and situations, supporting and pushing the transition towards flexible, intelligent and responsive automation, which we continuously seek and support.

The IFRA Group undertakes innovative research to design, create and improve Intelligent, Responsive and Flexible automation & assembly solutions, and this series of GitHub repositories provide background information and resources of how these developments are supported.
